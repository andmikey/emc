# Exeter Mathematics Certificate Project

## What is this?
As part of the ['Exeter Mathematics Certificate'](https://www.exetermathematicsschool.ac.uk/curriculum/) I completed a year-long independent research project.

My project was investigating machine translation of poetry using statistical methods.

This repository contains the work I presented for this project: a report, a poster, and the slides of my presentation.

## Give me an overview!
My final report was split into three parts:

### Background
An overview of the history of computational linguistics and machine translation, and a discussion of the motivations of my work.

### Theory
The mathematical theory behind statistical machine translation (aimed at beginners: I build up from discussing cognitive and statistical approaches to language, to a more detailed look at SMT).

### Discussion
Using an example poem, I discuss how one might translate a poem (Goethe's `Nachtlied`) by hand, following Nabokov's theory of poetic translation.
The meat of my project is the discussion of how one would approach a computational translation of this poem. I present three hypotheses on how modern statistical machine translation methods could be improved to better translate poetry
