\paragraph{}{The previous two hypotheses may improve poetic qualities
  of translations, but they may not necessarily preserve the poetic
  techniques that were used in the original poem. There are two
  possible ways to approach this:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hypothesis constraints, which can preserve such features as line
  length (syllable and word), rhyme, or meter. \cite{genzel}
\item Post-processing: in effect, building a translation system from
  non-poetic to poetic English.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}{However, we are still faced with the problem of how to
  identify poetic techniques computationally. This is more difficult:
  nonetheless, some methods have already been developed to, for
  example, discover rhyme schemes.}
