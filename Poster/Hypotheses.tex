\paragraph{}{I have developed three hypotheses regarding how current
  phrase-based statistical approaches could be improved to better
  translate poetry:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Training the language and alignment models on a poetic corpus
  improves poetic qualities of output translation.
\item Altering the sentence alignment model for poetic works will
  improve line-by-line translation quality.
\item Poetic characteristics can be preserved by constraints on the
  hypothesis space, or recovered by post-processing of the output
  translation.
\end{enumerate}
