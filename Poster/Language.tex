\paragraph{}{In machine translation, a language model is needed to
  make the output sound fluent in the target language. To estimate its
  probability distribution, we take a monolingual corpus and use
  $n$-grams to estimate the probability of word sequences.}
\paragraph{}{Language models are very sensitive to their training
  corpus: the training corpus should be in the same domain and on the
  same topic as the items to be translated. Therefore, I hypothesize
  that training the language model on a poetic corpus will increase
  the poetic qualities of a translation. Part of my research involved
  building a poetic corpus from the Project Gutenberg collection,
  which is large enough to feasibly use to train real models.}
