\paragraph{}{An alignment model is used to translate words or phrases
  from a foreign language into our target language. With a phrase-based
  translation system, we segment our input and output text into
  aligned phrases, and use these to build a probability
  distribution. We estimate this probability distribution by expanding $\Pr(f|e)$:
  $$\Pr(\bar{f}_1^I | \bar{e}_1^I) = \prod_{i=1}^j
  \phi(\bar{f}_i | \bar{e}_i) \ d(\text{start}_i - \text{end}_{i-1} -
  1) $$}
\paragraph{}{I hypothesize that we can separate poems into two
  different classes, which should have different alignment models
  applied to them, specifically with reference to sentence
  boundaries:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Poems whose sentences can be treated in the same way as prose: standard sentence boundaries can be used to segment sentences.
\item Poems whose sentence boundaries are marked by line-endings,
  rather than punctuation.
\end{enumerate}
